Thrilled to share my Python-powered journey into global homicide trends! Leveraged pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to decipher patterns. Interactive geospatial analysis with Plotly Express provided insights into worldwide crime distribution. This project showcases Python's transformative power in making data narratives engaging.
