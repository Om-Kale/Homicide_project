# Homicide_project
🌐 Exploring Global Homicide Trends with Python 📊🌎

I'm thrilled to share the completion of my latest project where I delved into global homicide trends using Python and various data analysis libraries! 🐍📈

📌 Key Highlights:

<1>Data Exploration: Leveraging pandas and NumPy, I meticulously explored vast datasets to understand patterns and trends in global homicide rates.

<2>Visual Insights: Utilizing Matplotlib, Plotly Express, and Seaborn, I translated complex data into visually compelling charts, making the insights accessible to a broad audience.

<3>Geospatial Analysis: Plotly Express allowed me to create interactive maps, shedding light on the geographical distribution of homicides worldwide.
